# Learning Rust with Examples

This repository contains my notes and code examples as I work through the [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/) book.

## About This Repository

I follow the book closely, implementing the examples and concepts as presented. However, I've made some personal adjustments:

- **Variable values**: I sometimes use different values in variables to make examples more meaningful or memorable to me
- **Additional comments**: I've added my own comments throughout the code to help me understand the concepts better and reinforce my learning

## Structure

The code examples are organized following the book's structure, making it easy to cross-reference with the original material while including my personal learning notes and insights.
